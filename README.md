## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage that pulls data of known UFO sightings into a dynamic table for users to look through. We have also provided a filter on this webpage that allows users to sort through the data in multi-criteria, making their UFO hunting even easier to achieve. 

## Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
### Welcome 
When users first interact  with Dana’s webpage they will be greeted with a giant banner “the truth is out there” and a quick note of where the data is sourced, several quotes from a ufologist and a blurb encouraging the user to dig through the data and form their own opinions. 
### Filters and how the page will pull up before filters are applied.

### Filters being used 
There is a lot of data to look through, to make it easier to shift through this data users can use the filters provided.Users can filter by date, city, state, country and shape. One or more filters can be applied to help narrow the search for the truth seekers visiting the site.

## Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
Overall we have constructed a webpage that is user friendly and easy to help users filter through the documented UFO sightings. One of the drawbacks for this new design is users must enter the search catiria exactly how it appears within the dataset. So if a user types “Fresno”, instead of “fresno”, no results will be generated.

### Recommendation:
Enhancements to improve Dana’s webpage would possibly use a drop down menu for each criteria so users can see each city that has a sighting and this also avoids no results being generated due to misspelling or entering cities/states that are not found in the data. 
Better filters for users to expand date range search. For example, entering a year or a month and a year to see the overall sighting in that date range does not work. I can see this being helpful for users, since it may be rare that a user would have a particular day in mind to search.
